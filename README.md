# Vardan_blood-donating-and-receiving-website
This is a website that was created as a part of a national-level College hackathon for the people who need blood urgently, but can't really find the donors, in those times of distress smoothly. The motivation of the website is to play match-making among the donors and receivers and make this whole process smooth, with a user-friendly and engaging UI/UX as well as crisp and clearly oraganised information.


Currently, the website only contains front-end and no back-end as in such. We plan to add the information of the donors and receivers and make it a fully functional one.


Anybody, who is interested is welcome and can freely fork the repository to make better developmnts and changes(front-end and back-end included), and join us in our journey of serving mankind.
